	in the command echo the parser might not put spaces if the cmd args is not in nested quotes for example:
	echo a a or echo a                   a --> should result in : echo a a
	meanwhile the parser gives : cmd : echo , cmd args -> [a, a],
	so please consider adding a single space between command args when executing the command echo
